Show 1 Code Example Each Of Linear Time Complexity and Quadratic Time Complexity.

Big O time is the language and metric used to describe the efficiency of algorithms. Big O measures time complexity or runtimes, and space complexity in a given algorithm. Big O Notation is written according to its performance in the worst case scenario.

O(1) Constant Complexity
The input to the algorithm does not matter - the algorithm will still take the same amount of time to run. O(1) algorithms are extremely efficient.

tinyArray = Array(10).fill(0)
largeArray = Array(100000000).fill(0)

findFifthElementOfArray(tinyArray)
findFifthElementOfArray(largeArray)

function findFifthElementOfArray(arr) {
	return arr[4]
}

O(N) Linear Complexity
O(N) is somewhat efficient. No matter how big the constant is or how slow the linear increase is, at some point the linear algorithm will have a longer runtime

tinyArray = Array.from(Array(10).keys())
largeArray = Array.from(Array(100000000).keys())

findRandomNumberInArray(tinyArray)
findRandomNumberInArray(largeArray)

function findRandomNumberInArray(arr) {
  const randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (randomNum === arr[i]) return arr[i]
  }
}

O(log(N)) Logarithmic Complexity
O(log(N)) is very efficient. By their nature, these algorithms can solve complex problems very quickly.

const n = 16777216

log(n)

function log(n) {
  let j = 0
  
  for(let i = n; i >.999; i /= 2) {
    console.log(
			`The result of iterion ${j} is ${i}`
		)
    j++
  }
}

O(N^2) Quadratic Complexity
O(N^2) is inefficient and should be avoided if possible.

const fakeTwoDimensionArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

logArray(fakeTwoDimensionArray)

function logArray(arr) {
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    console.log(arr[i])
    for(let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++){
      console.log("i: ", arr[i], "j: ", arr[j])
    }
  }
}

O(N log(N)) Log Linear Complexity
This Big O variant is a common runtime of many sorting algorithms.

nLog(8)

function nLog(n) {
  let i = 1
  for(let j = 0; j < n; j++){
    for(let k = 0; k > 0.999; i /= 2){
      console.log(`The result of iteration ${i} is ${k}`)
      i++
    }
  }
}

O(2^N) Power of 2 Complexity
Is a Fibonacci sequence and is used for calling a functino recusively twice within a recursive function.

function fibonacci(n) {
	return n <= 1 ? 0 : n <= 2 ? 1 : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

O(N!) Factorial Complexity
Factorial Complexity occurs when every possible solution to a problem may have to be calculated for the correct output to be determined.

Space Complexity
The vast majority of data structures (Arrays, lists, linked lists, Hash Tables, etc.) have a space complexity of O(N) - as the size of the data structure increases the space it takes up increases along with it. Many sorts have a space complexity of either O(1) or O(N).

function sumAndProductOfArray(arr){
  let sum = 0
  let product = 1

  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i]
  }
  arr.forEach(element => {
    product *= element
  })

  console.log(`Sum: ${sum}`)
  console.log(`Product: ${product}`)
}
