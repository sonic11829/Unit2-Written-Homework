❓ Describe the MVC Diagram that we have been using in class?
~My best explanation is you start with the visitor, the visitor sends a request to he main server (node.js), node works with express which manages the HTTP server. Express then works with the DB (mongo DB and or Mongoose JS) and at the same time asks for the HTML template from JSX. (note that express only askes for the template from JSX once and then only works with the DB from then on). Once the database fires back all info requested from Express, Express then compiles all the data and fires back all the information requested by the visitor as a response for the visitor. ~
